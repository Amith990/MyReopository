/* Database Schema for COMP5013 debate web application.
   Note: MySQL supports a reduced form of full SQL, so this file should not be taken as
   an example of what to do in a full SQL database design.

   WARNING: RUNNING THIS DDL FILE WILL DELETE ANY EXISTING DEBATE TABLES IN THE DB!

   SqLite has no CHAR or VARCHAR types, only TEXT which can be any length.

   SqLite also has no DATETIME type so it is assume dates are stored as INTEGERs representing
   Julian time (the number of seconds passed since 1 Jan 1970). SqLite's date functions support
   storing dates this way.
